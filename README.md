I am a professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin - Stout where I teach courses in introductory physics, quantum mechanics, lab experimentation, and quantum computing.

I am interested in incorporating computational modeling in the curriculum and I am Editor-in-Chief of the Partnership for Integrating Computation Into Undergraduate Physics.
